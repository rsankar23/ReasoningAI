001_yaml_format,"Consider the following two yaml:

```yaml
thought: I need to resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'langchain_community'` error by ensuring that all necessary dependencies are correctly installed.
selfCriticism: I should have verified the installation of all required dependencies before running the code.
command:
  name: runPython
  args:
    code: |-
      import sys
      !{sys.executable} -m pip install langchain openai langchain_community
    requirements: |-
      langchain
      openai
      langchain_community
```

```

THe content of the two yaml are the same, but the format is different. The ""thought"" and ""selfCriticism"" value in the second yaml is in block style which is what I want. 

I need a typescript function ""function convertToBlockStyleYaml(yamlString: string): string"" to convert the yaml to the second style and return the converted yaml string.

Code Only, no explanation.

Hint: The input yaml may not be a valid yaml, but you should convert it to the new format to make it valid.",This test mainly focuses on reasoning-depth. It re...,,the typescript function `converttoblockstyleyaml` has been implemented as requested. it converts the...,True,1,6,4
