2. Install the libraries within the hf_requirements.txt file in the HuggingFace directory.
3. Ensure you have a HuggingFace API Key (preferrably with a PRO subscription) to be able to leverage the model and ReAct agents.
4. Run 'streamlit run app.py' from within the HuggingFace folder to begin application.

### Note:  Install Watchdog library for better debugging.
